# Coursera Developing Data Products Week 2 Peer-graded Assignment: Leaflet

In this project, we created a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet, representing the number of incoming passengers per station on the Parisian RATP railroad network in 2015.

The source data sets are not included in this repository. To reproduce this web page, you will need to download the following files and place them in a subdirectory named `data`:

- `positions-geographiques-des-stations-du-reseau-ratp.csv`, from (https://data.ratp.fr/explore/dataset/positions-geographiques-des-stations-du-reseau-ratp/information/) (geographic position of stations on RATP network).

- `trafic-annuel-entrant-par-station-du-reseau-ferre-2015.csv`, from (https://data.ratp.fr/explore/dataset/trafic-annuel-entrant-par-station-du-reseau-ferre-2015/export/) (annual traffic by station on railway network 2015).

- `traces-du-reseau-ferre-idf.csv`, from (https://opendata.stif.info/explore/dataset/traces-du-reseau-ferre-idf/) (layout of the ÃŽle-de-France railway network).
